# Project week 05, 2023-04-02

## Summary
  - Read even more, most of the Spade papers and a thesis on FPGA fixpoint optimization
  - Moved texts to the template, and finialized the plan according to latest notes

## Realizations
  - I need to get started on the implementation
  - I feel like I'm well read on the area of FPGAs and fixpoint arithmetic now, multiple papers have talked about measuring things the way I will measure and the method is feeling more and more valid.

## Questions
  - What is my definition of done? My original thought was implement the inference and see where I end up, but maybe the optimizations are more interesting for the department. Either I focus more on the compiler, which is probably where I'm more comfortable, or I lean into the FPGA stuff more.
