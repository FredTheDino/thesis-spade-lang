# Project week 01, 2023-03-06

## Summary
  - A lot of reading
    - Read about integer arithmetic
    - Read about affine arithmetic
    - Read about FPGA word optimizations
    - Read Spade guide
    - Lacked setup instructions for simulators and the likes, not sure if I will need it
  - Setup Spade compiler
    - Built and compiled and installed rust tools
  - Try to define the work more clearly
    - Might focus more on correctness and model checking? 
  - Try to find problems with the approach
    - `a - 2a` requires affine arithmetic at least for correct results

## Realizations
  - I need to understand the domain of hardware languages more throughout
    - I should put more time into learning Spade lang
    - I should learn VHDL, at least a little
    - I need to mess around with both of these languages
  - There's a huge overlap with this thesis and model checking and over estimation, I should look more at static analysis literature
  - Hardware languages can't really have loops or recursion (unless finite depth)
    - This is a huge simplification for model checking
    - The language is smaller than I thought
  - Writing is a good way for me to cement what I've learned

## Questions
  - Good books on static analysis?
  - I need to understand FPGAs and hardware more, are there other limitations like no loops allowed?
