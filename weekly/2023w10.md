# Project week 02, 2023-03-12

## Summary
  - Poke a bit in the Spade compiler
    - Tried to fix https://gitlab.com/spade-lang/spade/-/issues/218, got a crash :D
    - How does the structured logging work? I didn't get the debugger to work, maybe my installation is off?
  - Read about how hardware works
  - Lots of time went towards other stuff this week

## Realizations
  - The spade language has very little documentation. 
  - I probably need to communicate more when I work on spade compiler related things.

## Questions
  - How can I debug the compiler when I get a stackoverflow?
  - Is there any form of documentation about what kinds of functions exist? I've rummaged through the files in the repo and found some stdlib files which I've referenced and I think it works?
