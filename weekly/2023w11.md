# Project week 03, 2023-03-19

## Summary
  - Created first issue for the spade compiler
    - Constructed a fix
    - How does the structured logging work? I didn't get the debugger to work, maybe my installation is off?
  - Read some more about IA and AA
  - Skimmed some typechecker code
  - Lots of time went towards other stuff this week

## Realizations
  - I'm not sure AA is the right tool for calculating the bit usage of expressions. Because AA doesn't allow holes in the over estimation space, it assumes the possible values are always continuous, maybe there's a better version of bit utilization where we track the possible values instead. AA and IA are good solutions, but are they the best solutions? I'm not convinced.
  - I think adding more typechecker tests and try to refactor a bit of the code is a good idea before I jump into adding IA or AA to the integer maths

## Questions
  - How big is the statespace for a circuit normally?
  - Could we track all possible values a circuit could take? 
  - Could we reason about the correctness of functions in `spade-lang`?
