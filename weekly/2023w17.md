A lot of implementation experiments to hopefully find the best change that takes the least amount of time and gives the best report.

## Summary
  - https://gitlab.com/spade-lang/spade/-/merge_requests/198#note_1374174984
  - Did like 4 experiments with implementation (only one is pushed)
  - Did some speculating on what I think we will need

## Realizations
  - I don't think I need to write a new typechecker to do this as I feared once
  - The code quality is (usually) pretty good in the codebase
  - The way constraints are set up makes it hard to inspect them (at least I find it hard) - I probably need to add more tracing

## Questions
  - See any problems with my approach?
  - Is there something I've explained poorly?
