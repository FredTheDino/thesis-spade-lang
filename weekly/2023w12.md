# Project week 02, 2023-03-5

## Summary
  - Read even more, mainly Affine Arithmatic and hardware stuff
  - Started work on the planning
  - Padding out my background and introduction the template, not yet presentable

## Realizations
  - I better get to writing stuff
  - I need to be better at measuring hardware, and I think power draw and complexity of the circuit could be a good place to start
  - I hope to start poking around in the codebase more, either fixing a small bug or actually starting on the 

## Questions
  - I feel like my writing is unclear and unstructured, is there anything that can help with that?
  - Is there a page limit for a thesis?
  - I usually go for "it's better to cut things out later", but is that the right approach here?
