No Rainbow is a constraint satisfaction problem.
The No Rainbow problem is finding a surjective node coloring of an r-regular hyper-graph.
This thesis extends on the work done by Ghazaleh Parvini and David Fernandez-Baca ~\cite{sourceNoRainbow}.
A faster algorithm using equivalence classes is suggested, evaluated and proved to be correct.

Other ideas for potential algorithms are also suggested.
