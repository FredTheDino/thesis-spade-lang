\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chaIntro}
Computers are a part of our everyday lives and all computers have something that computes, a compute unit. In some cases this is a dedicated general CPU but in some cases it can be purpose built hardware. A modern way of building hardware is -- funnily enough -- by writing programs that can be mapped to hardware. If you want to create a special circuit you would a Hardware Description Language, or HDL for short. One of these HDL is Spade, a HDL with a focus on usability which borrows much from the modern programming language \cite{src:spadeSomething} \cite{src:spadeAnHDL}. By writing high level code when describing hardware, we also open the door for optimizations and help from the compiler. This is the topic of this master thesis, a specific kind of optimization and user-help that can make Spade faster and safer.

This thesis focuses specifically on wordlength inference. Using a novel approach of combining wordlength inference with type inference. Wordlength is the number of bits to allocate to a value and when creating hardware you often have to specify this yourself. Getting this wordlength right everywhere can be tedious and time consuming. A small error in the wordlength might cause faults in the program and a too large wordlength wastes resources.
Since the compiler has access to all the source code for the hardware, the compiler should be able to check the wordlengths everywhere and potentially optimize the wordlength where bits go unused. Putting these optimizations in the compiler allows code to be more general and easier to reuse, a common good practice in the software industry today. 

\section{Motivation}
Creating more powerful tools allows us to do more powerful things with them. In the case of software this effect is even larger, anyone with a laptop and a dream can develop programs for anyone to use. One of these fundamental tools is the compiler and programming languages -- no one in their right mind would use FORTRAN today when they have alternatives like Go, Rust or Python. Bringing this mindset to the hardware world could increase the productivity, usability and accessibility to custom circuits and accelerators. HDLs have the huge potential of improving all computation speeds in the world. It is questionable if this thesis alone will take us as far as to revolutionize the hardware industry, but it is certainly a step in the right direction for energy-efficient and faster computations.

\section{Research questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How can interval arithmetic and affine arithmetic be used to implement wordlength inference?
  \item How does wordlength inference and optimization affect the number of LUTs, DPS-blocks and memories for a circuit?
  \item Can wordlength inference be used to create more reusable code?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Aim}
This thesis will implement wordlength inference in the Spade compiler using a combination of interval arithmetic and affine arithmetic. The implementation should then be evaluated using a synthesis tool and compared to other Spade-programs without these optimizations.

\section{Delimitations}
The sample size of the programs is quite limited, there is no attempt made to generalize the findings to all hardware. This thesis is limited to Spade and FPGAs and will not consider optimizations on other kinds of hardware. Other more sophisticated error-estimation like ME-gPC and modified addine arithmetic will not be studied.
