No work is never truly ones one, there are always others that inspire and teach you new things. I want to specially thank my supervisor Frans Skarman for being very supportive and understanding. Alicia Peterson deserves a special mention for being very huggable when there was a lot of thesis to write. I also want to thank the grumpy old rainbow-man who doesn't understand recursion. Finally Chocolate for always being there for me.
