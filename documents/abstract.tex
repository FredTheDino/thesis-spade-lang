Programming languages are complex programs that can aid software development a lot. This thesis modifies the Spade HDL -- a user friendly programming-language for hardware. This thesis outlines a method for developing wordlength inference directly into the Spade-language, this is done via multiple smaller implementations in an agile-like development process. The wordlength inference is then evaluated by doing multiple place and routes. No measurable difference in hardware-resource usage can be found due to the changes in this thesis. The real value of this work is however in enabling more sophisticated language features in the Spade compiler though the wordlength inference presented in this thesis requires more integration work to function truly well.
