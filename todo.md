# Things to research
  - [x] Affine Arithmetic and Interval Arithmetic
    - [ ] Summarise and formulate
  - [ ] AC-Types

# Things to do
  - [ ] Fix something in Spade
  - [ ] Write a project plan
    - Preliminary title
    - Preliminary problem statement relating to suggested literature
    - Preliminary description of method and scientific approach
    - Planned literature supporting the thesis
    - Plan for the execution as well as planned dates for intermediate (half-time) control and presentation
    - Expected preliminary results that can be demonstrated at the half-time check
    - Risk analysis for different aspects of the thesis, for example, data sets for evaluation, shortcomings in the method, reasons for delays, missing/delayed hardware/software

# Problems
  - Consider the case `a = a - 2a`, how should this be handled? If there are mutable variables here, things get messy quickly and most reasoning breaks down.
    - Affine Arithmetic solves this

# Ideas
  - The compiler could potentially try different combinations of addition and multiplication which
  - Optimizing FPGA designs is something that is well researched, which is nice
